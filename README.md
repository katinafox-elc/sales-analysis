## Project 1: Sales Analysis

### Overview

In this project, you will analyze sales data to calculate total sales by customer. You will work with two datasets: `sales_data.csv` and `customer_data.csv`. The `sales_data.csv` file contains information about individual sales transactions, while the `customer_data.csv` file contains details about each customer.

Your task is to import both datasets into Python, join them on a common column (e.g., customer ID), and aggregate the data to calculate the total sales for each customer.

### Learning Objectives

*   Import data from CSV files using Python libraries.
*   Join two datasets based on a common column.
*   Aggregate data to calculate summary statistics.

### Dataset Description

*   `sales_data.csv`: Contains sales transaction data, including customer ID, product ID, quantity, and unit price.
*   `customer_data.csv`: Contains customer details, including customer ID, name, and location.

### Step-by-Step Tasks

1.  Import the `sales_data.csv` and `customer_data.csv` files into Pandas DataFrames.
2.  Join the two DataFrames on the `customer_id` column.
3.  Calculate the total sales for each customer by aggregating the sales data and summing the relevant columns (e.g., quantity * unit price).
4.  Display the results, showing the total sales for each customer.
5.  Find the most profitable product.
6.  Find the customer with the highest order total.
7.  Find the product with the most sales.
8.  Find the customer who has the most orders. 

### Submission Instructions

1.  Create a new repository in your GitHub Classroom account for this project.
2.  Write your Python code to complete the tasks described above.
3.  Save your code as a `.py` file (e.g., `sales_analysis.py`).
4.  Add the `sales_data.csv` and `customer_data.csv` files to your repository.
5.  Commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository.
6.  Submit the link to your GitHub repository through Google Classroom.

**Note:** Make sure your code is well-commented and easy to understand. Include explanations for each step and any assumptions you made.
